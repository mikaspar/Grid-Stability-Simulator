# Grid-Stability-Simulator
An interactive simulator for power system stability analysis. Model and visualize the dynamic response of an interconnected grid to major disturbances. It simulates frequency control (FCR, aFRR) and voltage regulation with BESS/STATCOMs. Tune parameters in real-time to analyze the impact of inverter-based resources.
